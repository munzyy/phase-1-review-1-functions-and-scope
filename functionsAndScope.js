/* Exercise # 1 - Block Scope: The while loop as seen below contains a block of code.
 * A variable named "day" has been declared and assigned the value of "Monday" inside of this while loop.
 * What happens when you try to access the value of this variable outside of the while loop?
 */

// Print out the value of the "day" variable here using console.log(), and notice what happens in the console.

// Exercise # 2 - Function Scope: What happens when you try to console log the value of "iceCreamFlavor" inside the "createIceCream" function vs outside of the function?
let iceCreamFlavor = "Strawberry"
function createIceCream(iceCreamFlavor){

// Exercise # 3 - Global Scope: What happens when you create a variable in global scope and change that variable's value inside of a function or block of code?
let pasta = "Capellini"

// What will the value of "pasta" be now? Print out the value of the "pasta" variable using console.log() and find out!

/* Deliverable # 3:

 * Step 2 - Inside of the "playASport" function, declare a function named "playSoccer" that prints the string "GOAL!!!" to the console.
